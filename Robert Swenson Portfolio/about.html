                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I have been interested in computers for the past 25 or more years. I started building my own PC's in the mid-90's and have built and rebuilt many since then. I worked 
                       for about 4 years as a PC technician until the company I worked for went out of business. While working there, I was tasked with building and repairing PC's and minor networking.
                       I am currently working at a Pulp Mill as a Lead Operator in the Digester section. I started learning Web Development and JAVA in July of 2019 and have never looked back.
                       The ability to take an idea and turn it into something that you can see and interact with on screen is an amazing feeling.</p>
